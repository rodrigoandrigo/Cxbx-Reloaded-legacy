// D3DDevice_SetBackBufferScale — disabled.
// Host-only concept (upscale factor); Xbox native code doesn't need this.
// Patch disabled in Patches.cpp.

// D3DDevice_SetGammaRamp — disabled (PRMDIO VGA DAC palette emulation handles gamma natively).
// Implementation moved to Direct3D9.cpp.unused-patches.

// D3DDevice_GetGammaRamp — disabled (PRMDIO VGA DAC palette emulation handles gamma natively).
// Implementation moved to Direct3D9.cpp.unused-patches.

// CxbxrImpl_GetBackBuffer2 — removed.
// Was only called by D3DDevice_GetBackBuffer patches (now disabled).
// Backbuffer surface is known from CreateDevice (g_pXbox_BackBufferSurface).
// Implementation moved to Direct3D9.cpp.unused-patches.

// D3DDevice_SetViewport — disabled (trampoline-only after CxbxImpl_SetViewport removal).
// Patch disabled in Patches.cpp — Xbox code runs unpatched.

// CxbxImpl_SetViewport — removed.
// The Xbox trampoline writes viewport state to the NV2A push buffer.
// PGRAPH VPSCL/VPOFF registers are the authority; g_Xbox_Viewport was
// only written here and had no render-thread readers.

// D3DDevice_SetShaderConstantMode_0__LTCG_eax1 — disabled.
// Patch disabled in Patches.cpp — let Xbox code run unpatched.

// D3DDevice_SetTexture — disabled.
// Xbox native SetTexture pushes NV097_SET_TEXTURE_OFFSET to the push buffer.
// Host texture lookup uses PGRAPH TEXOFFSET registers set by the push buffer.
// Patch disabled in Patches.cpp — let Xbox code run unpatched.

// D3DDevice_SwitchTexture — disabled.
// Xbox native SwitchTexture updates texture offset mid-draw via push buffer.
// Host texture lookup uses PGRAPH TEXOFFSET registers.
// Patch disabled in Patches.cpp — let Xbox code run unpatched.

// D3DDevice_SetTransform — disabled.
// Transform state now sourced from PGRAPH XFCTX registers (MMAT0/CMAT/TnMAT).
// Patch disabled in Patches.cpp — let Xbox code run unpatched.
// Test case: 25 to Life (MultiplyTransform should call SetTransform internally)

// D3DDevice_MultiplyTransform — disabled.
// Xbox native code calls SetTransform internally which pushes NV2A transform methods.
// Patch disabled in Patches.cpp — let Xbox code run unpatched.

// D3DDevice_SetStreamSource (all LTCG variants) — disabled.
// Xbox native SetStreamSource writes NV097_SET_VERTEX_DATA_ARRAY_OFFSET/FORMAT
// to the push buffer. Host vertex binding reads PGRAPH state.
// Patch disabled in Patches.cpp — let Xbox code run unpatched.
